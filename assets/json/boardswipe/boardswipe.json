The keyboard smoothly slides away, giving you instant access to your full screen content. Works with the system keyboard, third-party keyboards, and even keyboard extensions.\n\n**Swipe Up to Switch:**\n\nHave multiple keyboards or languages installed? Swipe up on the keyboard to instantly cycle through them. No need to tap the globe icon - just swipe and switch. Perfect for multilingual users who frequently switch between languages while typing.\n\n**Haptic Feedback:**\n\nEvery swipe gesture provides subtle haptic feedback, so you know your gesture was recognized. The vibration confirms your action, making the experience feel responsive and natural.\n\n**Force Prediction Bar:**\n\nEnable this option to ensure the autocorrection and prediction bar is always visible, even in apps that normally hide it. Great for users who rely on predictive text suggestions."
